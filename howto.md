# Markdown Parsing and html / pdf generation


### Parsing & Rendering Markdown


- mdgen.php is used to parse a markdown file in [php markdown extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
into html. it's used like so:
  1. First launch a server: `php -S localhost:8000 &`
  2. Go at `http://localhost:8000/output.html`
  3. Launch parser: `./mdgen.php input.md > output.html`  
- vendor folder and composer.* files are required for php script to work
---

- R markdown parser is used like so: `R.exe -e "rmarkdown::render('$in')"`  (or use `knit()` function defined in `profile.ps1`)
- To convert a html generated output into pdf see `html_to_pdf`
---

### Generating html with markdown based on pandoc templates

- To fill the pandoc html template with the required info for a given course, 
fill an "empty" markdown file, with just the YAML header specifying
each value to be filled. Make sure to exaclty match the parameter names
setup in the html template.
For an example / list of values, see the example in `example/desc-content-example.md`  
Then call `pandoc <desc-content-file.md> -t html --template=<desc-template.html> -o <filled-course-desc.html>`
Replace the name in `<>` by the actual path to the file.  

---

NB: In the end php markdown extra, was not used and R markdown was
used only to generate the core/base (css) theme for the pandoc html template.
(It was inspired from the "downcute" theme available
here: [rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats).)  
_Hence the only dependency for this part is pandoc._

# DB access & Requests


**base url:** `https://pgc.unige.ch/main/api/`  

Exemple:

    GET https://pgc.unige.ch/main/api/activities/languages  //  return available languages
    GET https://pgc.unige.ch/main/api/academical-years/2019 //  return details for the given academical-year
    GET https://pgc.unige.ch/main/api/teachings/2022-11X001 //  return details for given course at given year


## Parsing


### Which field from the database is relevant ?


Each JSON response is **significantly** big, there is **a lot** of data duplication.
E.g. if a course is given to several different section/departments then almost every information
about the teachers giving the course will appear at least more than 1 time.  
Which begs the question "which field is relevant?", which is what we will record here in
an approximate [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.


#### Course:

Request: `GET https://pgc.unige.ch/main/api/teachings/<courseYear>-<courseId>`


The necessary fields to fill the class [Course.scala](https://github.com/David-Kyrat/Course-Description-Automation/blob/master/src/main/scala/ch/Course.scala) are located as following:


```YAML

- academicalYear  # year
- code   # id
- activities:
    # lectures: 
    -  - title   # name 
       - duration   # hoursNb.lectures
       - periodicity   # Semester
       - objective     # objective of course is in the `objective` field of 1st element of list of activities (the lectures)
       - description   # idem as for objective
       - bibliography  # idem (documentation)
       - language
       - evaluation   # evalMode
       - intended   # study plan names
       - variousInformation   # check if all variousInfo contains the same category of info => they dont
       - comment       # idem
       - activityTeachers:
       - - displayFirstName  # n-th teacher first name
         - displayLstName    # n-th teacher last name

       - type  # presence of type = exercies indicate hoursNb.exercices > 0, idem for hoursNb.practice
    # exercices:    
    -  - duration # hoursNb.exercices 

    # pratice:    
    -  - duration # hoursNb.pratice (if present)

- facultyLabel   # faculty
- listStudyPlan:  # List of each study plan that has this course
    - studyPlanLabel
    - planCredits
    - facultyLabel

```

The information "mandatory/optional" course is given as follows:

- if `listStudyPlan[i].studyPlanLabel` contains "Cours Ã  option" then it is not mandatory
- otherwise it is. (for each study plan `i`)

!! does not works all the time, e.g. Bachelor "Maths-Info" theres is more
than almost 30 courses in 3rd year and none of theme says "option" and 
it is extremely unlikely that the bachelor actually contains > 30 courses for the 3rd year...

## Packaging

Using [Wix](https://wixtoolset.org/) and the [sbt-native-packager](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/index.html) an MSI executable can be created with the command  
`sbt 'Windows / packageBin'`. To clean and update the changes in `build.sbt`, run `sbt bloopInstall 'Windows / packageBin'`.

Unfortunately, this require a **heavily** configurated `build.sbt` config file. 
Actually the heaviness isn't really the issue here, but rather the "outdatedness" and scarcity of actually usefull the informations. That's what makes the packaging / installer generation *really* time consuming. 

Left to do:
- [x] Find a way to bundle `res/` directory with the installer
- [ ] Find a way to force project installation in document directory and add symlink the "pdf" folder next to the .exe
- [ ] Find a way to put it in smth like `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` to make it searchable from windows seach 
- [ ] Small GUI

- [ ] Find a way to generate an executable instead of `.bat`
    - [ ] If that's not possible just hide the `.bat` and make a C wrapper that calls it.
    The wrapper will then be compiled as `.exe`  

Not urgent:
- [ ] Remove empty (0 Kb) / useless wix features (from "features to be installed" screen)
- [ ] Replace the lorem ipsum in the license screen by an actual license 


The actual wix configuration of the installer is present in the file `target/windows/Course-Description-Automation.wxs` file.
It's just an xml file with a specific microsoft-defined syntax see here [Course-Description-Automation.wxs](target/windows/Course-Description-Automation.wxs)
