              Romances were an extremely popular genre of texts in medieval England and are fascinating texts to explore medieval cultural values, societal norms and their transgressions. In this seminar we will look at one common motif of romance: the heros journeying into far-away lands: the mysterious and tempting East. In this seminar we will explore how different romances (love romance, fairy romance, Crusades romance, nationalistic romance) construct different Orients. We will see how the Orient is alternately represented as a magical, fairy-like place or a `real geographical place, a place of otherness and exoticism or a place of political and religious conquest. We will familiarize ourselves with critical theories such as Orientalism and place studies and read important scholarship on otherness and racism in medieval literature.
