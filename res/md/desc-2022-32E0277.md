description:  |
              Geoffrey Chaucer lived in 14th-century England. He was the son of a merchant and worked as a civil servant all his life. He did not belong to the clergy or the aristocracy, which were associated with education and literacy. Yet he became one of the most influential writers in the history of English literature. Through a close analysis of several tales in his last work, The Canterbury Tales, we will study how his art and intelligence made a lasting difference. We will see how he transformed well-established genres (such as dream visions, fabliaux, animal fables, and romances), and offered new perspectives on human interactions and traditional forms of thinking.
