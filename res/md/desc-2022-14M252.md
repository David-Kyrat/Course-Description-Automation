            This course gives and introduction to algebraic geometry and develops the theory of complex algebraic curves.
description:  |

              2.	Rational curves.
              3.	Algebraic curves as complex manifolds. Branched coverings. The Riemann-Hurwitz formula.
              4.	Line bundles and divisors on curves.
              5.	The RiemannRoch theorem for curves.
              6.	Metrics of constant negative curvature and uniformization theorem.

prerequisite:  |
               Pr√©-requis : Good knowledge of multi-variable calculus and algebra (the more, the better !), familiarity with complex analysis (holomorphic functions, Cauchy's integral formula) and topology (convergence, homotopies, homology groups).
