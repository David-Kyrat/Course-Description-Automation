              This course is an introduction to major texts of medieval English literature, such as the epic poem Beowulf, Chaucers Canterbury Tales, the anonymous Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and Thomas Malorys Le Morte Darthur. These remarkable texts played an important role in the history of English literature and culture.
